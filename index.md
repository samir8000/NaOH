# Sodium Hydroxide

Sodium Hydroxide, otherwise referred to as caustic soda or lye, is an ionic compound composed of the sodium cation (Na+), and the hydroxide anion (OH- ). It is highly soluble in water and is highly alkaline. It is a useful industrial product, but is not often used in home products, due to some of its harmful properties, such as corrosiveness, which would be harmful if it came in direct contact with humans.

### Toxicity
Sodium hydroxide is not toxic. its harmful nature comes from its corrosiveness.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
### pH Increase in Aquatic Environments
One environmental harm that may arise with sodium hydroxide is that it can increase the pH of water. This can cause harmful effects in aquatic organisms. However, it is only harmful if it is present in high concentration, as low concentrations of sodium hydroxide will be neutralized by other compounds in the water.<br>
