## Dissociation Equation
NaOH(s) ---> Na+(aq) + OH-(aq)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
## Molar Concentration Calculation
Given: 40.0g NaOH, to produce concentration of 0.60mol/L<br>
<br>
<br>
Required: Volume of water to be added<br>
<br>
<br>
Formulas: 
n = m/M<br>
c = n/V<br>
<br>
<br>
Calculations:<br>
n<sub>NaOH</sub> = m<sub>NaOH</sub> / M<sub>NaOH</sub><br>
n<sub>NaOH</sub> = 40.0g / 40g/mol <br>
n<sub>NaOH</sub> = 1 mol<br>
<br>
<br>
c<sub>NaOH</sub> = n<sub>NaOH</sub>/V<sub>NaOH</sub><br>
0.60mol/L = 1mol / V<br>
V = 1mol / 0.60mol/L<br>
V = 1.67L<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
## Solution Dilution Calculation
Given: Stock solution of 1.5mol/L NaOH<br>
<br>
Required: Volume of stock solution needed to produce a 2.0L 0.85molNaOH/L solution<br>
<br>
Formula:
c<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub> = c<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub><br>
<br>
Calculations:<br>
(1.5mol/L)(V<sub>1</sub>) = (0.85mol/L)(2.0L)<br>
(1.5mol/L)(V<sub>1</sub>) = 1.7 mol<br>
V<sub>1</sub> = 1.7mol / 1.5mol/L<br>
V<sub>1</sub> = 1.13 L<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
## Solution Stoichiometry Calculation
Given: 3.5 L of 1mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution, 0.5mol/L NaOH solution<br>
<br>
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>(aq) + NaOH(aq) ---> NaCl(aq) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l)<br>
<br>
Required: Volume of NaOH solution required to neutralize<br>
<br>
Formulas:<br>
n{H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>} = n{NaOH}<br>
n = c * V<br>
<br>
From above formulas: c{H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>} + V{H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>} = c{NaOH} * V{NaOH}
<br>
<br>
Calculations:<br>
c{H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>} + V{H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>} = c{NaOH} * V{NaOH}<br>
1mol/L * 3.5L = 0.5mol/L * V{NaOH}<br>
V{NaOH} * 0.5mol/L = 3.5 mol<br>
V{NaOH} = 3.5mol / 0.5mol/L<br>
V{NaOH} = 7L<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Solubility 
As temperature increases, the amount of NaOH that can be dissolved increases. This is due to the increase in energy of the molecules, facilitating the breaking of the solute's bonds. <br>

### Polar vs Non-Polar Solvent
Sodium hydroxide is more soluble in polar solvents than non-polar solvents:<br>
For ionic compounds (such as sodium hydroxide) to be dissolved in a non-polar solvent, ionic bonds as well as the attractions between the non-polar molecules would need to be broken, forming ion - nonpolar attraction. The formed attraction would be significantly weaker than the attractions that needed to be broken, making it an endothermic process, requiring energy to facilitate it. However, with a solvent such as water (polar molecule), the attraction between water and the ions that are formed can be sufficiently strong to make the process only slightly endothermic or even exothermic.
