## Sodium Hypochlorite Production
Sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) is produced via a method known as the Hooker process, the only large scale production method of NaClO. Chlorine gas is passed through a cold dilute sodium hydroxide solution (both are coproducts of the [chloralkali process](https://samir8000.github.io/NaOH/applications/industrial/chloralkali)), leading to them reacting in a disproportionation reaction (where chlorine is both reduced and oxidized) (May, 2011):<br>

### Functions:
- Bleaching
- Dental fluorosis stain removal
- Disinfection
- Malodour removal<br>
<br>
#### Bleaching
Liquid bleach, is in essence a dilute solution of sodium hypochlorite (3-6%), although it contains small quantities of secondary ingredients such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and calcium hypochlorite (Ca(ClO)<sub>2</sub>). It serves the main function of whitening and removing stains (May, 2011).<br>

#### Dental Fluorosis Stain Removal
A study on the clinical efficacy of a dilute sodium hypochlorite solution on the removal of dental fluorosis stains by Flores et al. (2009) found that in a process involving the application of a 5% sodium hypochlorite solution to teeth with dental fluorosis stains (stains caused by overexposure to fluorine as permanent teeth develop (CDC, 2019)), there are noticeable positive changes in the whiteness of the teeth enamel (in terms of changes in brightness and redness). This is a cheap, simple, and non-invasive process of combatting dental fluorosis stain.<br>

<br>
#### Disinfection
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2008) recommends disinfecting reusable objects that come into contact with mucous membranes by immersing them in a 1:50 dilution of 5.25-6.15% sodium hypochlorite solution for 3 minutes, 70% isopropyl alcohol for 5 minutes, or 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 minutes.<br>
<br>
In the context of medical facilities, they also recommend a 1:100 dilution of a 5.25-6.15% sodium hypochlorite solution for decontaminating nonporous surfaces after exposure to small amounts of blood or OPIM (other potentially infectious materials). They recommend a higher concentration (1:10) for exposure to larger amounts (>10ml) of blood or OPIM, as well as in the case of a biological culture spill.<br>

<br>
#### Malodour removal
Areas of the home such as drains, sinks, discharge pipes, toilets, and waste bins are known to be more conducive to repulsive odours, due to bacterial accumulation. Sodium hypochlorite is an effective product at killing the bacteria responsible for bad odours. (International Association for Soaps, Detergents and Maintenance Products, 1997)<br>

### Environmental Risk
Sodium Hypochlorite, if directly inserted into an aquatic environment, is highly toxic to nearby aquatic life. Despite this, it does not pose an environmental risk, except in cases of its misuse. After sodium hypochlorite solutions (bleach) are used, they go through treatment plants, where they are diluted and decomposed to the extent that they pose no longer a risk to the environment. Further, the sodium hypochlorite that does reach fresh water decomposes due to factors such as sunlight, pH, temperature, and salinity. As a result, the only case in which sodium hypochlorite presents an environmental risk is its misuse, where it is directly spilled into the environment. (The Soap and Detergent Association, 1997)<br>
