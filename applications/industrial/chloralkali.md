## Chloralkali Process
The Chloralkali process is a process based on the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride to produce as main products chlorine gas and sodium hydroxide. The three main methods of this are the diaphragm cell, the mercury cell, and the membrane cell.<br>

Two possible reductions:<br>

(Since there is a much more negative cell potential associated with the reduction of 
sodium ions than of water, it is less likely to occur, so we can presume that Reaction 2 will occur)<br>
<br>
Two possible oxidations:<br>

Reaction 2 (reduction) + reaction 3 (oxidation):<br>

Reaction 2 (reduction) + reaction 4 (oxidation):<br>

<br>
Since reaction 6 has a less negative electrode potential, it would seemingly be more likely to occur, although due to overpotential of O<sub>2</sub>, reaction 5 is the more probable outcome. <br>
