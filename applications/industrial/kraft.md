## Kraft Process
### Process
*Based primarily on information from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (1990)*
<br>
#### Function
Converting harvested wood into cellulosic pulp to be utilized for papermaking. This process is the most common method for producing chemical pulp, accounting for over 80 percent of the pulp produced in America.

##### Disintegration of Wood
The kraft process shown in the above diagram starts by placing wood chips under high temperatures and pressure in a substance known as “white liquor”, consisting of sodium hydroxide (main constituent) and sodium sulfide dissolved in water. This white liquor chemically decomposes the lignin from the wood, which are polymers that play a key role in binding the cellulose fibers together to maintain the wood’s structure (making the product pulp more readily able to be transformed into paper).
<br>
NaOH + NaS<sub>2</sub> + Wood ---> Na-org. + S-org. + NaHS
“Na-org” represent a variety of compounds with sodium
<br>
“S-org” represent a variety of compounds with sulfur
<br>
“Wood” represents many organic compounds such as Lignin, Cellulose, Hemi-cellulose (Glucomannan, Xylan and other hydrocarbon groups), and Resins.
<br>
<br>
Wood composition:
- Cellulose: 38- 42 %
- Glucomannan: 2-20 %
- Xylan: 7-30 %
- Other hydrocarbons < 5 %
- Lignin 20-30 %
- Resins 2- 6 %
<br>
Final Product (cellulosic pulp composition):
- Cellulose: 72-73 %
- Glucomannan: 2-10 %
- Xylan: 10-30 %
- Other hydrocarbons. <1 %
- Lignin 2-5 %
- Resins: <1 %

##### Pulp Treatment

<br>
After the reaction, the products go through a pulp filter, which extracts the cellulosic pulp. The pulp then goes through washing processes, sometimes bleaching, afterwards being pressed and dried into the final product. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
### Residuals
The residual from filtering out the pulp is called “black liquor.” The black liquor at this point is around 13% solids. It is then concentrated in a multiple-effect evaporator, a process which evaporates the water in the solution using heat from steam, resulting in a concentration of about 55% solids.

<br>
<br>
The resultant mixture thereafter undergoes a process (called direct-contact evaporation) whereby in a bubble column reactor, a hot gas is used to vaporize the solvent of the black liquor, increasing the solid concentration (65%).

<br>
The concentrated (strong) black liquor is fired in a recovery furnace, which produces heat, facilitating a reaction of sodium sulfate (with carbon) into sodium sulfide and carbon dioxide 
(Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>(aq) + 2C(s) ---> Na<sub>2</sub>S(aq) + 2CO<sub>2</sub>(g), whose products react together (with oxygen) to form sodium carbonate and sulfur dioxide (2Na<sub>2</sub>S(aq) + 3O<sub>2</sub>(g) + 2CO<sub>2</sub>(g) ---> 2Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>(aq) + 2SO<sub>2</sub>(aq)).
<br>
The end product of this is a molten smelt consisting of sodium carbonate (main constituent), sodium sulfide, and other compounds. This smelt is dissolved in water, creating a solution called “green liquor.” The green liquor is then placed in a causticizing tank, calcium oxide is added. The calcium oxide reacts with the water, producing calcium hydroxide (CaO + H<sub>2</sub>O ---> Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>) which then reacts with the sodium carbonate, producing sodium hydroxide (to be reused in the wood digestion process).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>(aq) + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>(s) ---> CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) + 2NaOH(aq)
<br>
The calcium carbonate that is produced precipitates, and is then decomposed in a lime kiln at high temperatures to produce calcium oxide (to be reused in the causticizing tank).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) + heat ---> CaO(s) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g)
