## Kraft Process
### Process
*Based primarily on information from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (1990)*
<br>
#### Function
Converting harvested wood into cellulosic pulp to be utilized for papermaking. This process is the most common method for producing chemical pulp, accounting for over 80 percent of the pulp produced in America.

##### Disintegration of Wood
The kraft process shown in the above diagram starts by placing wood chips under high temperatures and pressure in a substance known as “white liquor”, consisting of sodium hydroxide (main constituent) and sodium sulfide dissolved in water. This white liquor chemically decomposes the lignin from the wood, which are polymers that play a key role in binding the cellulose fibers together to maintain the wood’s structure (making the product pulp more readily able to be transformed into paper).
<br>
<br>
NaOH + Na<sub>2</sub>S + Wood ---> Na-org. + S-org. + NaHS
<br>
<br>
“Na-org” represent a variety of compounds with sodium
<br>
<br>
“S-org” represent a variety of compounds with sulfur
<br>
<br>
“Wood” represents many organic compounds such as Lignin, Cellulose, Hemi-cellulose (Glucomannan, Xylan and other hydrocarbon groups), and Resins.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Wood composition:
- Cellulose: 38- 42 %
- Glucomannan: 2-20 %
- Xylan: 7-30 %
- Other hydrocarbons < 5 %
- Lignin 20-30 %
- Resins 2- 6 %
<br>
<br>
Final Product (cellulosic pulp composition):
- Cellulose: 72-73 %
- Glucomannan: 2-10 %
- Xylan: 10-30 %
- Other hydrocarbons. <1 %
- Lignin 2-5 %
- Resins: <1 %<br>

##### Pulp Treatment
<br>

<br>
After the reaction, the products go through a pulp filter, which extracts the cellulosic pulp. The pulp then goes through washing processes, sometimes bleaching, afterwards being pressed and dried into the final product. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
### Residuals
The residual from filtering out the pulp is called “black liquor.” The black liquor at this point is around 13% solids. It is then concentrated in a multiple-effect evaporator, a process which evaporates the water in the solution using heat from steam, resulting in a concentration of about 55% solids. <br>

<br>
<br>
The resultant mixture thereafter undergoes a process (called direct-contact evaporation) whereby in a bubble column reactor, a hot gas is used to vaporize the solvent of the black liquor, increasing the solid concentration (65%). <br>

<br>
The concentrated (strong) black liquor is fired in a recovery furnace, which produces heat, facilitating a reaction of sodium sulfate (with carbon) into sodium sulfide and carbon dioxide <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>(aq) + 2C(s) ---> Na<sub>2</sub>S(aq) + 2CO<sub>2</sub>(g)<br> 
whose products react together (with oxygen) to form sodium carbonate and sulfur dioxide<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2Na<sub>2</sub>S(aq) + 3O<sub>2</sub>(g) + 2CO<sub>2</sub>(g) ---> 2Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>(aq) + 2SO<sub>2</sub>(aq)).<br>
<br>
The end product of this is a molten smelt consisting of sodium carbonate (main constituent), sodium sulfide, and other compounds. This smelt is dissolved in water, creating a solution called “green liquor.” The green liquor is then placed in a causticizing tank, calcium oxide is added. The calcium oxide reacts with the water, producing calcium hydroxide (CaO + H<sub>2</sub>O ---> Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>) which then reacts with the sodium carbonate, producing sodium hydroxide (to be reused in the wood digestion process).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>(aq) + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>(s) ---> CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) + 2NaOH(aq)<br>
<br>
The calcium carbonate that is produced precipitates, and is then decomposed in a lime kiln at high temperatures to produce calcium oxide (to be reused in the causticizing tank)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) + heat ---> CaO(s) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g)<br>

### Methodology
<br>
Environmental problems assessed:
- Global Warming: CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O (emissions related)
- Acidification: SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>
- Eutrophication (over enrichment of soil): COD (chemical oxygen demand), PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, NO<sup>3-</sup>, total N, and total P
- Smog:  NMVOC, CO, CH<sub>4</sub>
- Human Toxicity: AOX, TRS, SO<sub>2</sub>, and NO<sub>x</sub>
- Waste Production<br>

<br>
<br>
### Results
#### Global warming
- Approximately 2.9 Mton CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents of greenhouse gas is emitted annually from the kraft pulp industry.<br> 
- Emissions: CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O (CO<sub>2</sub> accounts for almost all of the global warming contribution)<br>
- Biomass combustion for energy ranks the greatest contributor of the industry processes (65%) The second most contributory process is lime (calcium carbonate) burning (30%). Despite this, upon further analysis, these processes become less of a factor than it seems. The emission of CO<sub>2</sub> from biomass combustion is normally excluded from greenhouse gas effect measurements since it is of biogenic origin, so the carbon emissions are actually recycled, meaning a net 0 increase in emission. The CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the lime kiln is similarly disregarded as it reacts forming calcium carbonate. After this adjustment in analysis, the main greenhouse gas effect contributor becomes bunker oil use, with total emission reduced to 0.13 Mton CO<sub>2</sub>-eq/year.<br>

<br>
#### Eutrophying compounds:
- 2 kton PO<sub>4</sub>-eq is emitted
- NO<sub>x</sub> and PO<sub>4</sub> arises from fertilizer use 
- N and COD arises from pulp production unit

<br>
#### Tropospheric ozone precursors:
- 1.7 kton/year emissions 
- Main components: NMVOC (Non-methane volatile organic compounds), CO, CH<sub>4</sub>, and NO<sub>x</sub>
- CO accounts for the vast majority of the emissions
- Main producing processes: Biomass combustion (80%) and chemical recovery unit (14%)
- Total emissions are negligible in relation to this environmental problem
<img src = "https://samir8000.github.io/NaOH/images/kraftprocess11.png"><br>
<br>
#### Human toxicity:
- 6.9 kton C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>-eq/ year
- Pollutants considered: TRS, AOX, SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, and particulates
- Biomass combustion NO<sub>x</sub> emissions contribute the most to toxic substance emissions (2.07 kton equivalents / year)
- AOX emission from pulp bleaching and NOx emission from the chemical recovery unit are the are the next most contributory.
- Odorous TRS is emitted from pulp cooking and the chemical recovery unit<br>

<br>
#### Waste production:
- The majority of raw material residues (organic residues, bark and wood) are used as fuel for energy (which account for 283,240 ton/year) 
- Sludge from wastewater treatment plant (which are also used for energy after a dewatering process) account for 9,125 ton/year<br>
<br>
- Non-recyclable solids include lime mud, dregs and grits waste, which end up in landfills, are emitting from the chemical recovery unit as well as energy generation unit. 
- Lime mud to be landfilled: 60955 ton/year
- Other solid waste: 93075 ton/year.<br>

### Conclusion
- The significant subsystems relating to environmental pressures arising from the Kraft process are the energy generation unit, chemical recovery units, pulp production units, and wastewater treatment unit. 
- The Kraft process contributes to the greenhouse effect via the emission such as CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, and NO<sub>x</sub>. 
- The chemical recovery subsystem is the main source of SO<sub>2</sub> and inorganic solid waste, contributing towards the issue of acidification and waste production respectively. 
- Pulp bleaching is the major source of AOX, contributing to the emission of toxic substances. 
- Wastewater treatment (through the emission of P) is the most significant cause of eutrophication
- TRS, an odorous toxic substance, is emitted primarily during the pulp cooking and and chemical recovery unit.<br>
