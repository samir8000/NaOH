## Water Softening
Hard water is a term that describes water containing dissolved calcium, magnesium, and certain other metal ions primarily as bicarbonates, chlorides, and sulfates. Some problems that arise due to the hardness of water is that they make soap/detergents less effective; there can be deposits of calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, or magnesium hydroxide inside pipes and boilers, resulting in a reduction in heating efficiency (due to reduced water flow); and these specific metal ions in water can corrode metal pipes (McVean, 2020).<br>
<br>
The removal of these compounds from hard water via chemical reactions is known as water softening. One of the compounds that can be used for water softening is sodium hydroxide.<br>

A study by Malanova et al. (2014) details research on sodium hydroxide as a water softening reagent. In the experiment, their model of “hard water” was a solution of calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, its concentration being 84.16 mg/dm<sup>3</sup> of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The alkaline reagents used for softening were ammonium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide. The solution of sodium hydroxide (10% concentration) was 0.13 cm3 in the 50 cm3 hard water model solution of calcium bicarbonate.<br>
<br>
When sodium hydroxide is added to a solution of Ca(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, the (dissociated) hydroxide ions react with the bicarbonate ions, forming carbonate ions and water (reaction shifted to the right to reach an equilibrium):<br>

<br>
The calcium ions in the solution react with the produced carbonate ions to form calcium carbonate, which is importantly (for water softening) insoluble in water:

<br>
Reaction:<br>
Ca(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(aq) + 2NaOH(aq) ---> CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l) + 2Na+(aq)<br>
<br>
After calcium carbonate’s formation, it can be easily filtered out of the water supply since it is non soluble in water (a solid), resulting in the removal of calcium ions in the hard water, water softening. Although there are still sodium ions in the water, it does not pose the same problems as ions such as calcium or magnesium.<br>
