### Chloralkali Process
The Chloralkali process is a process based on the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride to produce as main products chlorine gas and sodium hydroxide. There are three main methods to accomplish this process, which are the diaphragm cell, the mercury cell, and the membrane cell method.<br>

### Water Softening
Hard water is a term that describes water with certain metal ions dissolved within it. Some problems that arise due to the hardness of water is that they make soap/detergents less effective; there can be deposits of calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, or magnesium hydroxide inside pipes and boilers, resulting in a reduction in heating efficiency (due to reduced water flow); and these specific metal ions in water can corrode metal pipes. The process of removing these ions from water is known as water softening.<br>
